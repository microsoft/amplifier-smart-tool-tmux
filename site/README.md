# Website

This repository's promotional page uses the Amplifier Smart Tools family theme.
Product page content lives in `site.json`. The canonical theme is maintained in
`microsoft/amplifier-smart-tools/site/theme`; this repository carries a versioned
copy so a build does not depend on a moving remote theme or an online service.
Theme version: 0.1.0. Theme code is MIT licensed.

## Build and preview

From the repository root, using Python 3.12 or later:

```sh
python3 -m venv .work/site-venv
.work/site-venv/bin/python -m pip install -r site/requirements.txt
.work/site-venv/bin/python site/theme/build.py
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory _site --bind 127.0.0.1
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000. Generated output belongs in `_site/` and is ignored.
The site is a static build; visitors need no Python runtime or account.

The `--family-owner robotdad` option points overview and catalog links at the
fork previews. Omit it for their Microsoft organization URLs. Individual tool
links retain their authors' owners. Keep the same setting across the family.
For a combined local preview, build each page with `--local --output` into a
shared preview directory named after its repository, then serve that directory.

## GitHub Pages

The Website workflow builds relevant pull requests without deploying. Relevant
pushes to main automatically build and publish to GitHub Pages. Enable Pages
with GitHub Actions as the source and allow main in the github-pages environment.
The manual Website action remains available for explicit publication of a branch.

Production navigation points to the Microsoft overview and catalog by default.
Set `family_owner` to robotdad only when intentionally previewing the forks.
All linked family sites must be published for cross-site navigation to resolve.

## Shared identity

Use the full family name, Amplifier Smart Tools, as one masthead and footer
identity. The overview explains the format and how to build a tool; discovery
and individual tool listings belong in the catalog.

Use plain punctuation, with middle dots permitted between Math, AI, Design, and
Engineering in the team name. Keep MADE and Microsoft Office of the CTO as text
attribution. Do not link to the internal team site. Preserve the shared navigation,
layout, typography, paper background, and gold details; a tool may set its own
accent, content, and image in `site.json`.

The image or diagram selected in `site.json` is copied from this repository at build time.
Their existing provenance remains there. Screenshots are labeled as screenshots;
concept artwork is labeled as illustration. Add demo video only when reviewed
footage is available. Do not use a fake player over a still image.

To update a vendored theme, run the canonical `site/sync_theme.py` with an explicit
target checkout, review the diff, and build again. It updates only `site/theme/`.
Page content stays in the owning repository. The family link registry holds only
navigation identity; the catalog's tool inventory remains `tools/*/source.json`.

## Motion assets

The shared title mark uses an eight-second looping GIF with a static PNG fallback.
Reduced-motion
preferences select the still image by default. Shared media lives in
`site/theme/assets/` and is included by the theme sync script. The original briefs
and generation provenance live in `amplifier-smart-tools/site/artwork/`.

The vendored theme is excluded from tool-specific lint and type checks to preserve
its shared source. The Website workflow validates it by building the site.

After merge, open **Settings > Pages** and select **GitHub Actions** as the source.
If the first deployment ran before Pages was enabled, rerun the Website workflow
with **publish** checked. Later website changes on main publish automatically.

This copy adds optional `--config` and family URL subpaths for multi-tool repositories.
